# TUSKKER - Project in collaboration with NOKIA

TUSKKAR is a web application that distributes tasks automatically to a member of a team using a machine learning algorithm. The application offers 2 roles, TeamLeader and TeamMember, each with different options and responsibilities.

My responsibility consisted of developing the front-end side of the application. This included:
- The Client part of the web app including the security part for the login page
- The interface designed in ASP.NET, C# and Bootstrap (HTML&CSS)
- Processing the data
